# Visual Studio Code Java Properties

A port of the [TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/java.tmbundle/blob/5f4204576e13a73c9dfce525d8ced41a39d004c3/Syntaxes/JavaProperties.plist)
Java Properties (`.properties`) syntax highlighting for Visual Studio Code.

Rebuild of the upstream [Java Properties](https://github.com/Ithildir/vscode-java-properties) extension by Andrea Di Giorgi.

## Note
This is a lightweight alternative to the [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) extension, which also provides syntax highlighting for `.properties` files based on the TextMate bundle.
